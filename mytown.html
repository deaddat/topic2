<h1> My Town </h1>
<p id="p1"> I grew up in a town called Peckham; moving from the south of Peckham at the age of 8 to the north of Peckham (so not much of a distance). </p>
<p id="p1">Peckham is based in south London, England, within the London Borough of Southwark.It was orginally part of the parish of Camberwell, in Surrey, which became the Metropolitan Borough of Camberwell with in the Country of London in 1889. </p>
<p id="p1"> The area is known for its diverse communities, mostly communities that have their origins in Bangladesh, the Caribbean, China, India, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Pakistan, Turkey, Eastern Europe and Vietnam. As well as these communities there has been a steady gentrifiation of some of the areas in the south of Peckham, including an influx of cafes, wine bars, niche shops and artists' studios. </p>

<p id="p2"> Peckham was the setting of the television sitcom "Only Fools and Horses, although the series was filmed elsewhere in its run as a regular series from 1981 to 1991, as well as Christmas specials until 2003. The television situation comedy "Desmond's", created by Channel 4, was filmed and set in Peckham. Also, comedies "Meet the Adebanjos" and "The Tboy Show (both directed by Debra Odutuyo) were set in Peckham. </p>
